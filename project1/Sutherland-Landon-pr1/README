Source Files
---------------------------------------------------------------
Client: webclient.c
Server: webserver.c
---------------------------------------------------------------

Known Bugs
---------------------------------------------------------------
Client
	Using make with webclient returns this error:
	.../webclient.c:345: undefined reference to `pthread_create'
	collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
	
	now I have included the pthread.h but for some reason, it
	just isn't working I use this command to compile webclient:
	gcc webclient.c -o webclient -lpthread
Server
	Same story as client
	gcc webserver.c -o webserver -lpthread
Downloads
	at 1000 threads server and 100 threads client and a 4 file
	workdload, some files sometimes don't through all the way,
	but moslty they do.  Its an edge case I'm willing to not
	pass 100%, but 98%.

Capabilities
---------------------------------------------------------------
Webclient
	Fully functioning multi-threaded client
	All command line flags work
Webserver
	Fully functioning single-threaded server
	All command line flags work
---------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions
---------------------------------------------------------------
Client
	if workload < number of threads
		some threads will be assigned the same file to get
	if threads < requests
		some threads will request its assigned file multiple times such that
		each thread does ~requests/threads requests/threads, regardless of
		how many times the same file is requested
	if requests < threads
		only enough threads will be created to handle the number
		number of requests (i.e. (-t 5, -r 3) => 3 threads created, not 5)
	if requests < workload
		only enough files will be read to satisfy the number of
		requests (i.e. (workload=4, -t 5, -r 2) => 2 threads created,
		2 files requested from workload)
